This repository is a compilation of my PostgreSQL projects, datasets, and related materials. It serves as a portfolio of my skills and experience in working with PostgreSQL for data management, querying, and analysis. The repository can be used for sharing and collaboration with others in the PostgreSQL community, and as a showcase of my work in this area.
